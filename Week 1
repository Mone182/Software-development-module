1. A Code Repository is an online or local service that hosts code sources and its related documents. 

2. It is useful for programmers in order to save and develop their current codes. This is helped by the structure a repository has: projects can in fact be saved in main or secondary folders as to keep the main structure in one, whilst working on the aspects to develop in others.

3. Software present in a machine are of different types
•	Operatiing System: Is the main software which without a Computer wouldn`t work at all. It either communicates with the hardware and let different components interact with them and lets the Applications run on that computer;
•	Utility Programs: They are software used for given tasks in order to keep or improve computer`s performances;
•	Software Development Tools: These are programmes used to develop other softwares and help with their creation, maintenance and testing.

4.  An Algorithm is the way that let us communicate with a machine. It converts a high level language (understandable by us) in to a binary code language that a machine can identify. It is composed by a strict sequence of commands to operate, generally implemented with key-words.

6.Python uses either a compiler and an interpreter: you can write commands which the shell will execute or insert expressions that will return a value

1)
print("Hello World")

2)
print ("Hello World")
print ("I am in my ISD class right now")
   
3)
yourname = input("Please enter your name  ")
print("Hello", yourname)
print ("How are You?")

4)
numberone=int(input("Please enter number one  "))
numbertwo=int(input ("please enter number two  "))
result = numberone * numbertwo
print("your result is ", result)
