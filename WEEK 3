1)1.	Which of the following conditions are true, if a is 13 and b is 14?
>>> a=13
>>> b=14
>>> a+1<=b
True
>>> a+1>=b
True
>>> a+1!=b
False

2.	What is the error in this statement?
if scoreA = scoreB :  
        print("Tie")

INVALID SYNTAX, = means assignment, not equal (==)

3.	Supply a condition in this if statement to test whether the user entered a Y:
userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
if â€¦
print("Goodbye")



4.	Find the errors in the following if statements.  Make corrections.
if x > 0 then :
       print(x)

DON'T NEED "THEN"

if 1 + x > x ** sqrt(2) :
         y = y + x

we need to add "import math" at the beginning or type "...x**math.sqrt(2)

letterGrade = "F"
if grade >= 90 :
letterGrade = "A"
if grade >= 80 :
letterGrade = "B"
if grade >= 70 :
letterGrade = "C"
if grade >= 60 :
letterGrade = "D"

AFTER FIRST "IF" WE HAVE TO TYPE "ELIF"
