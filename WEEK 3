1)1.	Which of the following conditions are true, if a is 13 and b is 14?
>>> a=13
>>> b=14
>>> a+1<=b
True
>>> a+1>=b
True
>>> a+1!=b
False

2.	What is the error in this statement?
if scoreA = scoreB :  
        print("Tie")

INVALID SYNTAX, = means assignment, not equal (==)

3.	Supply a condition in this if statement to test whether the user entered a Y:
userInput = input("Enter Y to quit.")
if …
print("Goodbye")



4.	Find the errors in the following if statements.  Make corrections.
if x > 0 then :
       print(x)

DON'T NEED "THEN"

if 1 + x > x ** sqrt(2) :
         y = y + x

we need to add "import math" at the beginning or type "...x**math.sqrt(2)

letterGrade = "F"
if grade >= 90 :
letterGrade = "A"
if grade >= 80 :
letterGrade = "B"
if grade >= 70 :
letterGrade = "C"
if grade >= 60 :
letterGrade = "D"

AFTER FIRST "IF" WE HAVE TO TYPE "ELIF" for next conditions

5.	Write a program that sets a password as ‘changeme’ and asks the user to enter the password and keeps asking until the correct password is entered and then says ‘Accepted’. 
The program should count how many attempts the user has taken and tell them after they have been accepted. 
Extra Challenge: 
If the user takes more than 5 attempts the program should say, ‘Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password’

password=input("enter your password to sign up \t")
print("password set \n\n")

count=0
answer=input("please, enter your password \t")
while count<5:
    count+=1
    if answer==password:
        print("accepted")
        print("you have made",count, "attempts")
        break
    else:
        print("Denied, you have made", count, "attempts/5 \t")
        answer=input("please, re-enter your password \t")
if count==5:
    if answer!=password:
        print("Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password")
    if answer==password:
        print("accepted")
        print("you have made",count, "attempts")


6. Using the flow chart below, construct the if..elif..else control structure.
magnitude=float(input("What is the magnitude on the Richter Scale?\t"))

if magnitude>=8.0:
    print("\nmost structures fall")
elif magnitude >=7.0:
    print("many buildings destroyed")
elif magnitude >=6.0:
    print(" many buildings considerably damaged, some collapse")
elif magnitude >=4.5:
    print("Damage to poorly constructed buildings")
else:
    print("no destruction of buildings")
    
7. What do the following nested loops display?  Hand trace. 

for i in range(3) :
      for j in range(1, 4) :
           print(i + j, end="")
print()

>>> 
123
234
345

It will print a sequence of number 1 to 3 included whose get another sequence (j) added. the command print(i+j, end="")
tells python to display them horizontaly whereas the second command print() tells python to dived each added sequence with a
separation, as if we pressed enter in a word document. it corresponds to the string command \n.
