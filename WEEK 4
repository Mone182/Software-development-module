Assume the following list:   a = [66.25, 333, 333, 1, 1234.5]

If you perform the following operations on the list:

a.insert(2, -1) ADDS THE NUMBER -1 AT THE SECOND POSITION, BETWEEN THE TWO 333
a.append(333)   ADDS THE NUMBER 333 AT THE END OF LIST  

Now you perform: 
a.index(333)  

a.remove(333)
What will the list look like? IT REMOVES THE FIRST 333 PRESENT IN THE LIST

a.reverse()
 What will the list look like? IT SWAPS OVER THE POSITIONS OF THE ELEMENTS
 
a.sort()
What will the list look like?  IT SORTS THE ELEMENTS ACCORDING TO THE TYPE, IN THIS CASE, SORTS THE NUMBERS BY ASCENDING ORDER

2. Write a short program to create a list of squares for numbers up to 10. 
Start with an empty list called squares and append squares of numbers from 0 up to 10.
