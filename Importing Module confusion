Well, confusion is more mine than python's..

HERE IS THE CLASS DEFINITION:

class Student():
    
    def __init__(self, firstName="",lastName="",studentNumber="",course=""):
        self.firstName=firstName
        self.lastName=lastName
        self.studentNumber=studentNumber
        self.course=course

    def showDetails(self):
        print(firstName,"\n",lastName,"\n",studentNumber,"\n",course)

    def askNewStudentDetails(self):
        firstName=input("Enter the new student's first name, please\t")
        lastName=input("Enter the new student's last name, please \t")
        studentNumber=input("Enter the new student's number, please \t")
        course=input("Enter the new student's course, please \t")


AND THESE ARE THE COMMANDS IN A NEW IDLE WINDOW THAT DON'T EXECUTE PROPERLY FROM THE SAVED CLASS DEFINITION FILE:

import Student

showDetails(self)

askNewStudentDetails(self)
